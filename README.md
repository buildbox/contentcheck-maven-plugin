# Maven Content Check Plugin

Maven Content Check plugin is able to perform various kind of content checks on project's output artifact (source file). There is a couple of use cases for such kind of check.

* legal issues 
 * source file must contain only approved 3rd party libraries
 * source file must contain a license file
* content completeness
 * source file must/must not contain some files
 
# Goals

## contentcheck-maven-plugin:check

The goal checks a content of specified source file (typically project artifact) and reports unexpected or missing entries.

### Usage

Create "content.txt" text file and put this file into "src/main" directory of the some module. This file contains allowed and also expected entries that the source file should contain. You can also let the goal 'generate' create initial version of this file.

Now you can run the goal by following command, but  ensure that the archive is present in module's target directory.

``mvn net.sf.buildbox.maven:contentcheck-maven-plugin:check``


## contentcheck-maven-plugin:generate

The goal generates a content definition from a given source.

You can run the goal by following command

``mvn net.sf.buildbox.maven:contentcheck-maven-plugin:generate``

## contentcheck-maven-plugin:show-licenses   

The goal shows license information for a source's entries. License information is gathered from dependency's POM, but a project may define additional mapping between files in a project archive and licenses. Please see section Additional license information structure.

You can run the goal by following command

``mvn net.sf.buildbox.maven:contentcheck-maven-plugin:show-licenses``

## Configuration
Put the following XML fragment to a POM file producing an artifact (e.g. WAR or exploded directory) on which you would like to perform Maven Content Check Plugin's goals.

    <plugins>
        <plugin>
	    <groupId>net.sf.buildbox.maven</groupId>
	    <artifactId>contentcheck-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	    <version>1.0.0</version>
            <configuration>
            <!-- optional configuration see below -->      
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>

The plugin might be configured by following properties. If a property is valid only for some goals then a goal name will be specified.

* *archive* The archive file to be checked. If *directory* is specified then *archive* is ignored.
 * Default ``${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}.${project.packaging}``

* *contentListing* (valid for goals: check, generate) The content definition file (source of true)
 * Default ``src/main/content.txt``

* *checkFilesPattern* An Ant like file pattern determines which files will be checked int the archive
 * Default ``WEB-INF/lib/*.jar`` (All JARs in WAR)

* *directory* The directory file to be checked, takes a precedence before *archive*
 * No default

* *failOnUnexpected* (valid for goals: check) Break the build when the source contains files that are not declared in the content definition file.
 * Default ``true`` 
  
* *failOnMissing*  (valid for goals: check) Break the build when the source doesn't contain all files that are declared in the content definition file.
 * Default ``false``

* *ignoreVendorArchives* If it's true then doesn't check vendor JAR files. A vendor JAR file is determined by a value (*vendorId*) in its manifest key (*manifestVendorEntry*).
 * Default ``false``
   
* *vendorId*  The vendor id. This value is used for JAR's manifest checking when *noCheckVendorArchives* is turned on.
    
* *manifestVendorEntry* The name of manifest entry that holds vendor's identification. This value is used for JAR's manifest checking when *noCheckVendorArchives* is turned on.
 * Default ``Implementation-Vendor-Id``

* *msgMissing* (valid for goals: check) Message used to report missing entry - uses the ``java.util.Formatter`` syntax to embed entry name.
 * Default  ``File is expected but not found: %s``

* *msgUnexpected* (valid for goals: check) Message used to report unexpected entry - uses the ``java.util.Formatter`` syntax to embed entry name.
 * Default ``Found unexpected file: %s``

* *skipPOMPackaging* modules with POM packaging are skipped (excluded from the content check)
 * Default value is ``false``

* *overwriteExistingListing* (valid for goals: generate) If it's true the 'generate' goal overwrite content listing file.
 * Default ``false``
 
* *csvOutput* (valid for goals: show-licenses) If true print the result of check to a CSV file in project build directory.
  * Default ``true``  

* *csvOutputFile* (valid for goals: show-licenses) The CSV output file that is used when (*csvOutput*) is turned on.
    * Default ``src/main/license.mapping``

Put the desired configuration properties into  ``configuration`` element

        <configuration>
            <${propertyName}>${value}</${propertyName}>       
        </configuration>


### Ignore your own artifacts

It's quite common to ignore own  artifacts during checking. The plugin supports such case and is driven by JAR's manifest.  You have to ensure that all internal artifacts or at least artifacts that you would like to ignore have a specific key/value pair in manifest files. You can do that by JAR plugin.

    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
        <configuration>
           <archive>
               <manifestEntries>
                   <Implementation-Vendor-Id>com.example</Implementation-Vendor-Id>                   
               </manifestEntries>
          </archive>
       </configuration>
    </plugin>

JAR plugin will produce ``MANIFEST.MF`` with key/value pair ``Implementation-Vendor-Id: com.example``.
 
Content check plugin has to be configured to *ignoreVendorArchives* for a given *vendorId*.

    <plugins>
        <plugin>
        <groupId>net.sf.buildbox.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>contentcheck-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <configuration>
            <vendorId>com.example</vendorId>
            <ignoreVendorArchives>true</ignoreVendorArchives>               
        </configuration>
    </plugin>

You can put to *vendorId* whatever you want. You can also use any other key instead of ``Implementation-Vendor-Id`` for matching. A key name is specified by property *manifestVendorEntry*.

       ... 
       <configuration>
          <manifestVendorEntry>Producer</manifestVendorEntry>
          <vendorId>com.example</vendorId>
          <ignoreVendorArchives>true</ignoreVendorArchives>               
       </configuration>
       ...

Matches every MANIFEST.MF with key/value pair ``Producer: com.example``.

## Content definition file structure

* empty lines and lines starting to # are ignored
* one entry per line
* path is relation to source root

WAR's content definition

    # This line is ignored
    WEB-INF/lib/akka-core_2.8.0-0.10.jar
    WEB-INF/lib/aopalliance-1.0.jar
    WEB-INF/lib/asm-3.2.jar
    
## Additional license information structure

Not all archive entries have to have license information defined in their POMs. Therefore you may define such additional information in JSON file ( ``src/main/license.mapping``). 

The JSON structure is defined as following

     {
       "licenses": [
           {
              "name" : "License name",
               "url"  : "License text URL",
               "files": [
                   "file name"
                ]
           }
       ]
     }
     
JSON license mapping example

     {
       "licenses": [
           {
               "name"  : "The LGPL license 2.1",
               "url"   : "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html",
               "files" : [
                             "aspectwerkz-nodeps-jdk5-2.2.1.jar"
               ]
           },
           {
               "name"  : "The BSD license",
               "url"   : "http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php",
               "files" : [
                             "antlr-2.7.6.jar",
                             "asm-3.1.jar",
                             "dom4j-1.6.1.jar"
               ]
           }
       ]
     }
